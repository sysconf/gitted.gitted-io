    // h3 Define and setup a machine with {sysconf}
    h3 {sysconf}: define and setup a machine
    p The {a(href=reference/sysconf/directory/) Sysconf directory convention} defines a directory structure similar to {e Dockerfile}â€™s or {e .deb} for packaging files that are installed on the target system and the setup scripts which run the commands needed to configure the system. Check the {ext(href=//github.com/sysconf/gitted.gitted-io) Sysconf profile of this gitted.io website} as an example.

    // p A Sysconf profile (directory) is a collection of different {i Sysconf layers}, that may be shared with other sysconf profiles. As an example, checkout the {ext(href=//github.com/sysconf/gitted.gitted-io) Sysconf profile of this gitted.io website}.
    // p The {i system} Sysconf directory is located at {e /sysconf} and is orga
    // p The {e sysconf/} directory can be installed at the {i system} level at {e /sysconf}, at the user HOME level at {e ~/sysconf} or for any purpose at any location. From there, symbolic links are created on the target tree that point towards to original files in {e sysconf/}. For example, a system-wide Sysconf with the sysconf.base layer will setup {e /usr/bin/sysconf} as a symlink to {e /sysconf/sysconf.base/tree/usr/bin/sysconf}.

  section
    h3 {sysconf-target}: access &amp; deploy machines
    p While {sysconf} has minimal functionality to work on the local system, {sysconf-target} provides a common interface to {a(href=reference/sysconf-target/init/) intialize} and {a(href=reference/sysconf-target/attach/) run commands} on a given remote or virtualized target. This single script contains various {a(href=reference/sysconf-target/#drivers) target drivers} like {target-driver ssh}, {target-driver lxc}, {target-driver docker} and others.

  section
    h3 {gitted}: import/export state data as Git branches
    p A system becomes a {q Gitted system} when its Sysconf profile contains the {ext(href=//github.com/sysconf/sysconf.gitted) {e sysconf.gitted} layer}. The {gitted} command manages the synchronization between Git branches and the {i state drivers} which are dedicated to import/export a specific kind of data (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, local dir, etc.) according to INI-style configuration in {e /etc/gitted/state/}.
    p For example, {e /etc/gitted/state/www-data.config} defines the {i state branch} named {e www-data}, a Git branch that is kept in sync with the {e /var/www} directory.
    // p Inspired by {ext(href=http://git-scm.com/) Git}, the 3 core commands are driver-specific:

  section
    h3 {gitted-target}: Git push-to-deploy and pull-to-backup
    p The {gitted-target} command uses {sysconf-target} to run the {e gitted} command on a specific target. It will create containers or vritual machines on the fly, as supported by {sysconf-target}. It also provides a local {e init} command which configures a local {e git ted} aliase and proper remote for easy Git fetch &amp; push operations.
