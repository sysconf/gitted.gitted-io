      | Driver: dockerfile:DIRECTORY          | Generate a Dockerfile directory
      | -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      |
      | Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications
      | inside software containers. Learn more at: https://www.docker.com/
      |
      | This driver generates a Dockerfile definition that 'docker build' can use to
      | build an image or share as a repository.
      |
      | See also the 'docker' driver, which works with live Docker containers and images.
      |
      | $ sysconf-target init dockerfile:DIRECTORY
      |
      |     The 'init' command creates DIRECTORY and generates the "Dockerfile" inside
      |     with a copy of Sysconf. Run 'docker build <directory>' to build
      |     the image including Sysconf and its updates.
      |
      | $ sysconf-target attach dockerfile:/directory/path --hybrid -- COMMAND
      |
      |     Run COMMAND in /directory/path. Be careful: it will run on the main system
      |     with the plain environment (this is not a "real" attach, just a simulation
      |     to help working with the Dockerfile dir).
      |     The --hybrid option is for safety of confirmation.
