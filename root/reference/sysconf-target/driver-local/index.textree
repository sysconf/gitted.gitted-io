      | Driver: local:[ROOT-DIR]              | Install on the local system
      | -------------------------------------------------------------------
      | 
      | This driver manages the Sysconf installation on the local system.
      | 
      | It is only meaningful with the 'init' and 'status' commands.
      | It has little added-value over the remote/virtualization drivers as 'init' is
      | the same as copying Sysconf to ROOT-DIR/sysconf/ and running 'sysconf' from there
      | to install it on ROOT-DIR.
      | 
      | ROOT-DIR (default: "/") is the root directory where Sysconf symlinks are installed.
      | 
      | # sysconf-target init   local:
      | 
      |     The Sysconf is copied to ROOT-DIR/sysconf/ and then installed on ROOT-DIR/.
      | 
      |     Be careful when using --force, espacially if ROOT-DIR is "/" as it may
      |     override files in your existing ROOT-DIR/sysconf/ pointed to by symlinks in ROOT-DIR.
      | 
      | $ sysconf-target init   local:$HOME
      | 
      |     As an unprivileged user, install Sysconf to our HOME directory and use
      |     ~/sysconf/ to store the Sysconf layers.
      |     This makes sense for *user* Sysconf layers (typically for managing user
      |     settings, .bashrc and the like).
      | 
      | $ sysconf-target init   local:/some/check --no-setup
      | 
      |     Can be used to check what is installed on a target: the Sysconf layers
      |     in /some/check/sysconf and all the symlinks installed in /some/check.
      | 
      | # sysconf-target attach local:/some/dir --hybrid -- COMMAND
      | 
      |     The 'attach' command just executes the command. It is dummy for such a local
      |     target, but it works with the --hybrid option.
