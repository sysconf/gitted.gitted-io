item
  question Is Git mandatory for Sysconf? Can I use SubVersion, Bazaar or nothing at all?
  answer
    p You are free. Sysconf is not tight with any version management system.
    p The logic of Sysconf defines how the /sysconf directory is organised, not how it should be versionned or synced.

item
  question Can /sysconf be located somewhere else?
  answer
    p Yes. A different path can be specified through the environment variable {e SYSCONF_PATH}.
    p You can specify it at call time:
    p.expr SYSCONF_PATH=/custom/sysconf/path sysconf <cmd> ...
    p Or make it permanent by adding {e export SYSCONF_PATH=/custom/sysconf/path} into your {e /etc/bash.bashrc} or {e ~/.bashrc}.

item
  question Can Sysconf symlinks be installed somewhere else than the root tree /?
  answer
    p Yes.
    p Edit {e /sysconf/target} (or {e $SYSCONF_PATH/target} if {sysconf} is located somewhere else) and change its content from {e /} to the directory you want the symlinks be installed into.
    p When you are done, run sysconf install to install the symlinks on the new location. You should probably clean any old symlinks: see How to uninstall sysconf below.

item
  question Can Sysconf be used by unpriviledged users?
  answer
    p Yes.
    p Of course if you canâ€™t write to {e /}, you need to customize {e SYSCONF_PATH} and {e $SYSCONF_PATH/target} like explained above.
    p Using {sysconf} at the user level is a common use case, to manage user config files like {e ~/.bashrc}, {e ~/.ssh/config}, {e ~/.gitconfig}, etc.
    p For that use, set {e SYSCONF_PATH} to {e /home/toto/sysconf} (for example) and put a single line {e /home/toto} into the file: {e /home/toto/sysconf/target}. Append the profiles you need and run {e /home/toto/sysconf/sysconf.base/tree/usr/bin/sysconf update} to get everything installed.

item
  question How to uninstall sysconf?
  answer
    p First, remove all links which have been installed by sysconf:
    p.expr # find /usr/bin/ /etc/ -type l -lname '/sysconf/*' | xargs rm
    p Then, remove sysconf itself and its repositories:
    p.expr # rm -rf /sysconf

item
  question How are Sysconf and Gitted related?
  answer
    p Sysconf does not depend on Gitted and Gitted does not depend on Sysconf. Although Gitted is commonly distributed through the {e sysconf.gitted} layer, it can be installed by other means and work properly without Sysconf at all.
    ul
      li {gitted-target} uses {sysconf-target} to reach {gitted} on remote machine
      li {sysconf-target} create virtal machines and containers and reach them all (SSH included)
      li {sysconf} configures a new or existing machine
      li {sysconf} installs the {gitted} setup
      li {gitted} upgrades {sysconf} like other machine state
      li driver-gitted-target makes the process recursive: manage guest machines as gitted state from a host (or peer) machine
