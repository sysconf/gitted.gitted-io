This *Git repository* is also a *Gitted repository* which embeds the
full definition of the [gitted.io](http://gitted.io/) website server
using 2 branches:

* _[sysconf/master](https://github.com/sysconf/gitted.gitted-io/tree/sysconf/master)_
  for the Sysconf definition of the website server

* _[textree](https://github.com/sysconf/gitted.gitted-io/tree/textree)_
  for the website content, powered by the
  [Textree text processor](https://github.com/geonef/sysconf.textree/)
  to render into HTML.

The official upstream repository is hosted on GitHub:
http://github.com/sysconf/gitted.gitted-io
